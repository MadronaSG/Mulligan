Mulligan - Sometimes you just need to call a Mulligan. 
========

Ever had one of those days? It's probably a Friday. You've definitely not had enough coffee. Traffic stunk.
You finally get to the office to be greeted with 90 requests for password resets and one email simply titled "oops"

Opps, it turns out, is a confession of sorts. Where you discover that a coworker just deleted 10 thousand Accounts. 

From the Production org. 

Oh, and all their child objects too. You know, the contacts, opportunities...

People are scrambling. The perp is hiding, his chatter status says "crying". 

But it's ok, You've got Mulligan; Your Save-the-day Bulk un-delete tool. Instead of checking next to 10
records one by one, simply select your object type from a picklist and optionally choose a start and stop date 
range to restore. Then just sit back and calmly demand that someone make a Fivebucks run. 
You've worked smarter, not harder, and you'd like a Quad no-fat carmel crunch mocha with extra crunch.
