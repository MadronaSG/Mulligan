<p>Ever had one of those days? It's probably a Friday. You've definitely not had enough coffee. Traffic stunk.
You finally get to the office to be greeted with 90 requests for password resets and one email simply titled "oops"</p>

<p>Opps, it turns out, is a confession of sorts. Where you discover that a coworker just deleted 10 thousand Accounts. </p>

<p>From the Production org. </p>

<p>Oh, and all their child objects too. You know, the contacts, opportunities...</p>

<p>People are scrambling. The perp is hiding, his chatter status says "crying". </p>

<p>But it's ok, You've got Mulligan; Your Save-the-day Bulk un-delete tool. Instead of checking next to 10
records one by one, simply select your object type from a picklist and optionally choose a start and stop date 
range to restore. Then just sit back and calmly demand that someone make a Fivebucks run. 
You've worked smarter, not harder, and you'd like a Quad no-fat carmel crunch mocha with extra crunch. </p>
