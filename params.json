You've definitely not had enough coffee. Traffic stunk.\r\nYou finally get to the office to be greeted with 90 requests for password resets and one email simply titled \"oops\"\r\n\r\nOpps, it turns out, is a confession of sorts. Where you discover that a coworker just deleted 10 thousand Accounts. \r\n\r\nFrom the Production org. \r\n\r\nOh, and all their child objects too. You know, the contacts, opportunities...\r\n\r\nPeople are scrambling. The perp is hiding, his chatter status says \"crying\". \r\n\r\nBut it's ok, you've got Mulligan; your Save-the-day bulk un-delete tool.
