You've definitely not had enough coffee. Traffic stunk.\r\nYou finally get to the office to be greeted with 90 requests for password resets and one email simply titled \"oops\"\r\n\r\nOpps, it turns out, is a confession of sorts. Where you discover that a coworker just deleted 10 thousand Accounts. \r\n\r\nFrom the Production org. \r\n\r\nOh, and all their child objects too. You know, the contacts, opportunities...\r\n\r\nPeople are scrambling. The perp is hiding, his chatter status says \"crying\". \r\n\r\nBut it's ok, you've got Mulligan; your Save-the-day bulk un-delete tool. Instead of checking that maddening\r\nbox next to 10 thousand records one by one, simply select your object type from a picklist; optionally \r\nchoose a start and stop date range, then click 'Call a Mulligan'. \r\n\r\nThen just sit back and calmly demand that someone make a Fivebucks run. \r\nYou've worked smarter, not harder, and you desserve a Quad shot no-fat caramel crunch mocha with extra crunch.\r\n\r\nIt's not often you undelete things, but when you do, you mulligan them. After all, you are the most interesting \r\nSalesforce admin in the world.\r\n\r\nLimitations, Caveats and other things.\r\n========\r\n\r\n1. So, yeah. Mulligan can only undelete objects that are in the recycle bin. If you have emptied the recycle bin, or exceeded the retention limit... your only option is to rick-roll your entire org and weep.\r\n2.
